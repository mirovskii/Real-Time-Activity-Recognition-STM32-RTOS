# Real-Time-Activity-Recognition-STM32-RTOS
This project implements a motion-based game control system that identifies human activities (walking, running, sitting, standing, jumping) in real-time. The system uses an IMU sensor attached to the user's leg and transmits control commands wirelessly via Bluetooth.
